see resolution.diff details.

comments about changes can be found in the sos_resolution.py near the effected lines
==========================

output contains 2 files, sos and standard.

standard contains the output generated by giving the vanilla resolution.py code the input files from input/

sos contains the output generated by giving the modified resolution.py (w/ sos) code the input files from input/



to execute:
  py sos_resolution.py
  -or-
  py sos_resolution.py input/<filename>

==========================

resolution.diff   --  diff file comparing vanilla resolution.py to sos_resolution.py
unify.py          --  a helper file
sos_resolution.py --  the main driver
input/            --  input data for sos_resolution.py
outout/           --  output generated by sos_resolution.py
